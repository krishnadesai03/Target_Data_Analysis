![target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfa58b19-f651-462e-8c61-ddcdcdfe4435)


## 🔍 Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analytics workflow using:

**Python** for data handling and visualization

**MySQL** as the database engine

**SQL** for querying the data

**💡 Goal**: To derive business insights from an e-commerce dataset and visualize the patterns in customer behavior, sales trends, and product preferences.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, mysql.connector)

MySQL (RDBMS for structured data storage and querying)

Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 Project Workflow
### 1. 📂 Data Import and Preparation

CSV files loaded into MySQL tables

Used mysql.connector to connect Python to MySQL

### 2. 📈 Querying the Database

Example: Get all unique customer cities

### 3. 📊 Visualizing Insights

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for bar plots, line charts, and histograms

3. Update your credentials in the notebook
4. Run the notebook to recreate the workflow

## 📌 Future Enhancements

1. Add a dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
2. Perform customer segmentation using clustering

## 🙌 Acknowledgements
Inspired by e-commerce datasets from Kaggle and real-world analytics use cases.
